# Your Data's Confidentiality: How We Handle Your Information
We understand that data privacy is paramount. That's why we want to assure you that your confidentiality is a top priority for our application. We've designed our system to be 70% confidential, focusing on minimizing the data we access and store.

# What Does "70% Confidential" Mean?
This percentage signifies our commitment to a high level of data discretion. It means that we do not collect or store any personal data from your usage, such as your name, email, or any behavioral patterns within the app. Our primary goal is to provide a service that respects your privacy from the ground up.

# The Only Data We Access: Your API Keys
The only "data" our application interacts with are the API keys that you, the user, explicitly provide. These keys are essential for the application to function, as they allow it to connect to the external services you wish to integrate. We do not generate, modify, or retain these keys beyond the immediate session or the necessary processing to fulfill your requests.

In essence, your data remains yours. We are merely a conduit for the information you choose to share with external APIs through your provided credentials. We never store the actual data retrieved from these APIs on our servers; it's processed and displayed directly within your application instance.
